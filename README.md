# Nordic Antiques Comparison software
I want to make a price comparison software to pull prices from competing companies.
Our business sells alot of [Royal Copenhagen stel](https://nordicantiques.dk/royal-copenhagen-stel) which we would like to monitor.
Especially the pieces [Blå Blomst](https://nordicantiques.dk/royal-copenhagen-stel) & [Musselmalet](https://nordicantiques.dk/royal-copenhagen-stel)

We would also like to monitor [Georg Jensen Sølvbestik](https://nordicantiques.dk/georg-jensen-soelvbestik) and [Bjørn Wiinblad](https://nordicantiques.dk/bjoern-wiinblad) where prices are fluctuating alot from shop to shop.

Please visit our [antik butik](https://nordicantiques.dk)
